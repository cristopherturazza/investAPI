# üí∞ investAPI

Simple REST API for manage investments

## üìñ About

This project consists of a simple REST API for storing investments and displaying statistics over time. It is equipped with a token-based authentication system of two types: one for read-only access, freely obtainable from the appropriate route, and another with write permissions, obtainable through basic authentication. Both tokens are valid for only one operation, after that the token expires.

This project is purely educational, aimed at learning how to use the technologies employed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Stack

- Typescript
- Node.js with Express
- PostgreSQL with Prisma

## üìã Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js (>= 22.2.0) installed locally and a PostgreSQL instance with a dedicated database.
Useful links:

- Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager (using nvm is highly recommended)
- PostgreSQL: https://postgresapp.com

Once PostgreSQL is installed, you can create a new database with this command:
`sudo -u postgres psql -c 'create database investapi;'`

## üöÄ Installation

Clone this project to your local machine and run the command:
`npm install`

Next, in the root folder, create your `.env` file following the example provided in the `example.env` file.

Once you've created and filled out the .env file, run the following commands:

1. `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`
   This command will correctly create the project's logical schema in the database.

2. `npx prisma db seed`
   This command will seed the database with some example investments data and one registered user. It creates sample investments and adds a test user with the following credentials:
   `test username: testuser`
   `test password: testpassword`

Once all these operations have been completed correctly, it is possible to launch the service with the command `npm run dev`.

## üß™ Testing

Inside the test folder, you can find a Postman Collection that can test the routes, with basic test scripts already integrated and a runner set up.
The collection is designed to automatically obtain a new token before each call that requires authentication. This process is fully automated within the Postman collection.
Username, password, tokens, and investment ID for some calls are saved in the Dev environment and automated.
